                            <p class="a1">The Avengers, American comic strip superhero team whose frequently changing
                                roster often included some of the most popular characters in the Marvel Comics universe. 
                                Billed as “Earth’s mightiest super-heroes,” the team was created by 
                                writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, and it debuted in The Avengers no. 1 (September 1963).</p>

                <h2>THE AVENGERS(2012)</h2>
                <p>The Avengers Initiative was the brainchild of S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury. 
                He first approached Tony Stark with the idea, following Tony’s defeat of Obadiah 
                Stane and his subsequent public announcement that he was Iron Man. Fury kept his
                eye on several potential members, as Bruce Banner struggled with life as the Hulk,
                the Asgardian Thor appeared on Earth, and Steve Rogers, AKA World War II hero Captain America, 
                was discovered alive decades after his apparent death. In the meantime, some of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s most
                skilled members, Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff), and Hawkeye (Clint Barton), were making a 
                name for themselves and impressing Fury.</p><br>
                <p>Once the Asgardian trickster god Loki arrived on Earth and absconded with the massively 
                powerful object known as the Tesseract—possessing Hawkeye and turning him into his brainwashed 
                pawn in the process—Fury found it necessary to finally bring together his potential super team, 
                calling in Romanoff, Banner, Rogers and Stark. Captain America and Iron Man, assisted by Black Widow, 
                were able to capture Loki, but during their flight back to S.H.I.E.L.D., Thor arrived, attempting to
                bring his brother back to Asgard to face justice. A fight ensued between Thor and Iron Man, but 
                Captain America broke it up, and the group all returned with their prisoner, Loki, to the S.H.I.E.L.D.

                <h2>AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON(2015)</h2>
                <p>Marvel Studios presents Avengers: Age of Ultron, the epic follow-up to the biggest Super Hero movie
                   of all time. When Tony Stark tries to jumpstart a dormant peacekeeping program, things go awry and 
                   Earth’s Mightiest Heroes, including Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye,
                   along with support from Nick Fury and Maria Hill are put to the ultimate test as the fate of the
                   planet hangs in the balance. As the villainous Ultron emerges, it is up to the Avengers to stop 
                   him from enacting his terrible plans, and soon uneasy alliances and unexpected action pave the way 
                   for an epic and unique global adventure.</p><br>
            <p>In 2015, the Avengers reassemble to track down and eliminate HYDRA remaining members themselves, using 
               Tony Stark's resources to help. Their latest mission brings them to the location of the alien Scepter that 
               Loki utilized during the Chitauri Invasion; the Scepter is now in the possession of Baron Wolfgang von 
               Strucker, one of the notorious heads of HYDRA who has been using energy drawn from the alien weapon to 
               power advanced weaponry, as well as attempting to empower living humans.</p>

                <h2>AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR(2018)</h2>
                <p>An unprecedented cinematic journey ten years in the making and spanning the entire Marvel Cinematic 
                   Universe, Marvel Studios' "Avengers: Infinity War" brings to the screen the ultimate, deadliest 
                   showdown of all time. As the Avengers and their allies have continued to protect the world from 
                   threats too large for any one hero to handle, a new danger has emerged from the 
                   cosmic shadows: Thanos. A despot of intergalactic infamy, his goal is to collect all six Infinity
                   Stones, artifacts of unimaginable power, and use them to inflict his twisted will on all of reality. 
                   Everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment - the fate of Earth and existence 
                   itself has never been more uncertain.</p>

                    <h2>AVENGERS: ENDGAME(2019)</h2>
                    <p>In 2018, twenty-three days after Thanos killed half of all life in the universe, Carol Danvers
                       rescues Tony Stark and Nebula from deep space and they reunite with the remaining Avengers—Bruce 
                       Banner, Steve Rogers, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and James Rhodes—and Rocket on Earth. Locating 
                       Thanos on an uninhabited planet, they plan to use the Infinity Stones to reverse his actions, 
                       but discover Thanos has already destroyed them to prevent further use. Enraged, Thor decapitates 
                       Thanos.</p>
